# The logons file specifies the number of times each user may logon to
# the bbs at once. It is here so that the default "logons" value in
# the bbconfig file may be overridden for certain users. For instance,
# you may allow unlimited logons by default, but set a guest account
# to a limited number in this file. Or allow only one logon for normal
# users with a higher logon limit for sysops given here.
#
# Format: userid:logon-limit
#
# guest:5  
# SYSOP:0
