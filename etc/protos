# This file lists the protocols available for uploads/downloads.
# You have to tailor this for your own site.
# 
# Record format:
# proto-name:send-command:receive-command
#
# If the receive-command is prefixed by '|', then the destination is
# opened as standard out of the receive-command. For example to do an
# ASCII upload we just "cat > filename". 
#
# If the receive-command is prefixed by '-'. then the receive program
# does not want filenames in the command. The default is to append the
# filename.
