# This is the bbs access file. For each function in libbbs.a, and a few
# more, a line here is required to tell the bbs what permissions are
# necessary to access each function. Be sure not to delete any of the 
# non-comments or no one will have access to some functions.
#
# For each function:
# ALL means all users can do this, regardless of permission bits.
# NONE means no users can do this. Not even Sysops.
# Strings from the permstrs file (see it for more info) are used to 
# restrict access to users with those permissions. For example the sysop
# functions have "Sysop". You can list more than one, separated by commas.
