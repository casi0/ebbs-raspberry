# EBBS Modes file
#
# The first 11 modes are used by the system. Users may get confused if
# you change the meaning of these. 0, 1, and 2 should not be set.
#
# From mode 11 up, they are defined locally to be used in the menu.desc
# file as an argument in the "exec" and "exec.pause" menu commands.
#
# Format: <mode-number>:<mode-char>:<mode-string>:<pageable>
#
# The maximum allowed mode number is 31.
# Mode-string may be up to 9 characters. Mode-char is a single character.
# These are what shows up in the (U)sers, (L)ist, and (M)onitor commands.
# Place an 'N' in the <pageable> field to denote that a user in
# this mode cannot be paged under any circumstances. This is a GOOD idea
# for any mode you add!
