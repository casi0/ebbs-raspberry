# This file lists the names of the permission bits.
#
# They are referenced in the access file to determine what permissions
# are needed to access each bbs function.
# 
# The following are reserved and should NOT be altered.
# Basic-1 through Basic-4 are given to each account automatically at creation.
# Sysop permission is needed to alter a user's permissions.
#
Basic-1
Basic-2
Basic-3

#
# The rest (up to 27 more, or 32 total) are only referenced in the
# access and menu.desc files. You can name them as you please.
# IMPORTANT! Never alter the order of permission names once you start 
# using them. That is, only add to the END of the list and if you want
# to delete a permission name, put something else in its place.
