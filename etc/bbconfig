# This is the main bbs config file. It MUST exist or the bbs will not run.
#
# Startup information is given here in name=value form. The things you
# specify here are:
#
# name: The name of your bbs. Up to 40 chars. Default=The Unknown BBS.
# new: If yes, users can enter 'new' at the login prompt and create
#      their own accounts. Otherwise they can't. Default=no.
# users: How many users can log in at once. Base this on the capacity
#      of your system, mainly on RAM. You can change this at any time,
#      perhaps automatically based on time of day, but it MUST be less
#      than or equal to the usertablesize parameter. Default=80.
# reservedslots: Of the number of user slots given by the 'users' value,
#      reserve this many for Sysops or other privileged users. The
#      UseReserved parameter in the access file determines who may use
#      these slots. Default=0 (no reserved slots).
# usertablesize: The size of the shared memory user table, in users.
#      Set this to the absolute maximum number of logins you expect to 
#      allow on at once in the foreseeable future. IF YOU CHANGE THIS
#      PARAMETER, you MUST shut down the bbs and chatd and remove the
#      shared memory segment with the ipcrm utility. If you fail to do
#      this, bad things will happen.
# logfile: The location of the bbs log file. Default=~/log.
# loglevel: Controls what events get written to the logfile. Default=1.
#      Higher numbers mean more logging.
#      System errors are always logged.
#      Level 1: Logins, logouts, and account creations
#      Level 2: Administrative actions
#      Level 3: Posts, uploads, downloads, forwards.
#      Level 4: Entries to chat/talk.
# logons: The number of times users can log onto the bbs at once.
#      Zero means unlimited. Use entries in the ~/etc/logons file to
#      override this default value.
# siglines: The maximum number of lines from a signature file to be appended
#      to posts and mail. If zero, signature is not appended.
#      Default=4.
# showreal: If yes, the real name of a user is returned with a Query.
#      Default=no. If yes, can be further restricted with the SeeRealName
#      setting in the access file.
# timeout: After this many minutes of no input, the local client may time 
#      out and boot a user. This is imprecise and the actual time before 
#      boot may range from 1 to 2 times this value. In Monitor mode, the
#      timeout is exactly 2 times this value. Default is 0, meaning no idle 
#      timeout. May be overridden with the NoIdleTimeout setting in the
#      access file. 
# encoder: Needed if you have binary files in your file section and want
#      to allow forwarding of them. Put the path to uuencode here.
# locale: Locale name (pathname). Default=<null>, the default locale.
