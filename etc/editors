# WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING
# DO NOT put your favorite shell editors here. Most editors can do lots
# of things you do NOT want bbs users to do! Like: escape to a shell,
# pipe shell commands, write or bring up files other than the one they're 
# editing. Your bbs can be BLOWN AWAY quite easily. You should only install 
# editors here that you have modified to be safe. You have been warned.
#
# The builtin editor need only be uncommented if there are other choices too.
# The builtin editor is always used as the default.
#
# The environment field uses the same format and substitution rules for 
# %I, %U, %T, %E, %H as described in the menu.desc file.
